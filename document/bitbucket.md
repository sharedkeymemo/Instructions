# Bitbucket integration

You can connect to Bitbucket.
To use Bitbucket, please get an account.
Once connected, a list of repositories owned by Bitbucket will be displayed.
You can select a repository to use for notebook management.
To use it, first register your public key.
If you output the public key from the SSH key screen, it will be output to the clipboard, so please add it to the Bitbucket SSH key.
You can use it by selecting the registered public key in the memo registration.
