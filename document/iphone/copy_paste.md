# Copy paste operation

Notes can be copied and pasted.
Useful when duplicating notes in another notebook.
However, the encrypted state is maintained, so the original password is required for decryption.
This function can also be applied to the entire tree, so it is possible to duplicate the entire notebook in another notebook. However, history is not included.
