# Password

It is used to encrypt and keep notes confidential.
Memos can be encrypted and decrypted by entering passwords individually, but it is possible to register them for easier operation.
Biometrics can be used for registration and use.

By using a password in the notebook, it will be temporarily stored.
Closing the notebook will erase the temporary memory. This memorization feature helps ensure consistent password management.
