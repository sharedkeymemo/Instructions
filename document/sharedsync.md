# Shared sync

If you specify Git Url, you can use the shared synchronization function.
Only available in confirmed state. If there are any changes, synchronization will not be possible, so please confirm them first.
Upload is a function to send update records to sharing destinations. This operation corresponds to Push in Git.
Download is a function that receives update records from the sharing destination and synchronizes them with the notebook. This operation is equivalent to Pull in Git.
If the notebook has been finalized but not uploaded, the change status will be displayed on the notebook icon.
Please upload as much as possible.
